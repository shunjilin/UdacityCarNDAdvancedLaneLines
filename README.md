## Advanced Lane Finding
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


My submission for term 1 project 4, see [advanced_lane_lines.ipynb](./advanced_lane_lines.ipynb) for implementation and [writeup.md](./writeup.md) for details.

In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.
